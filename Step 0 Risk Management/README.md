# Step 0: Risk Management  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Risk management is the most important part of trading and investing.  
> The first rule is **not to make money**‚Äîit is to **protect the money you already have**.  
> Without disciplined risk management, even the best strategies will eventually fail.

## Why Risk Management Comes First  

Most new traders think trading is about finding the fastest way to grow capital.  
In reality, sustainable success in markets comes from controlling **downside risk**.  
Without proper controls, volatility, correlation, and bad luck can erode an account faster than good trades can build it up.

## Volatility and Its Impact  

**Volatility** is the statistical measure of price variation over time.  

- üìâ **Negative effects on your account**: Even if the long-term trend is up, wide swings reduce compound returns (the ‚Äúvolatility tax‚Äù).  
- üòü **Investor confidence**: High volatility signals instability and discourages outside investors.  
- üí∏ **Effective liquidity**: When equity swings heavily, your ‚Äúusable capital‚Äù is uncertain, making it harder to size trades confidently.  
- üé≤ **Bad luck amplification**: A random streak of losses can wipe out more capital in a volatile account, making recovery exponentially harder.

## Key Investment Rules  

1. **Preserve capital** ‚Äì Never risk more than you can afford to lose.  
2. **Position sizing** ‚Äì No single trade should ever be able to ruin your account.  
3. **Diversification** ‚Äì Spread exposure across *uncorrelated* assets.  
4. **Defined risk** ‚Äì Always know your maximum drawdown thresholds.

## Correlation, Beta, and Hedging  

- **Correlated assets**: Assets whose prices move together. High correlation means less diversification benefit.  
  *Example*: oil prices and oil company stocks.  

- **Market beta (Œ≤)**: A measure of how sensitive an asset is to the overall market.  
  *Example*: A stock with Œ≤ = 1.2 tends to move 20% more than the market index.  

- **Hedging**: Taking a position that offsets risk in another.  
  *Example*: If long airline stocks, you might hedge with a long oil position (since rising oil hurts airlines).

## Portfolio Modelling Basics  

Before advanced models, simple tools include:  

- **Expected return** ‚Äì Weighted average of asset returns.  
- **Variance / standard deviation** ‚Äì Measure of portfolio risk.  
- **Covariance & correlation matrices** ‚Äì Show how assets move relative to each other.  

These tools answer:  
> *‚ÄúAm I actually diversified, or do I just own many correlated assets?‚Äù*

## Markowitz Portfolio Optimization  

Harry Markowitz formalized this in the 1950s with **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**:  

- Optimize weights of assets to **maximize expected return for a given risk**.  
- Uses **mean-variance optimization** to build the **efficient frontier**.  
- Core idea: A rational investor doesn‚Äôt just chase returns‚Äîthey balance returns against volatility.

## Closing Thought  

Every strategy‚Äîfrom a simple moving average crossover to advanced machine learning models‚Äîmust sit on top of **Step 0: Risk Management**.  

Without it, trading systems are fragile.  
With it, they can endure bad luck and survive long enough to benefit from skill.
