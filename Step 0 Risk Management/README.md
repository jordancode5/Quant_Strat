# Step 0: Risk Management  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Risk management is the most important part of trading and investing.  
> The first rule is **not to make money**‚Äîit is to **protect the money you already have**.  
> Without first understanding risk, and then maintaining disciplined risk management, even the best strategies will eventually fail.

## Why Risk Management Comes First  

Most new traders think trading is about finding the fastest way to grow capital.  
In reality, sustainable success in markets comes from controlling **downside risk**.  
Without proper controls, volatility, correlation, and bad luck can erode an account faster than good trades can build it up.

## Volatility and Its Impact  

**Volatility** is the statistical measure of price variation over time.  

- üìâ **Negative effects on your account**: Even if the long-term trend is up, wide swings reduce compound returns (the ‚Äúvolatility tax‚Äù).  
- üòü **Investor confidence**: High volatility signals instability and discourages outside investors. (Funds would rather welcome someone who is barely beating the market with low volatility than someone who has a high win percentage but is YOLOing their account on options)
- üí∏ **Effective liquidity**: When equity swings heavily, your ‚Äúusable capital‚Äù is uncertain, making it harder to size trades confidently.  
- üé≤ **Bad luck amplification**: A random streak of losses can wipe out more capital in a volatile account, making recovery exponentially harder.
- üìä **Limits sample size for evaluation**: If your position sizing is not disciplined, you won't have enough data to evaluate a strategy before you empty your account.
 *Example*: I test all of my strategies with #1 backtesting, #2 live testing on a paper account, #3 third-party review (yes, seriously!!), and #4 then if and only if the strategy passes all of those hurdles will it make it into my live account to risk only 0.3% of my account for day trades and 2% on a monthly time frame

## Key Investment Rules  

1. **Preserve capital** ‚Äì Never risk more than you can afford to lose.  
2. **Position sizing** ‚Äì No single trade should ever be able to ruin your account. (or your mood)
3. **Diversification** ‚Äì Spread exposure across *uncorrelated* assets. (Do not buy Nvidia to hedge against your data center stock ticker)
4. **Defined risk** ‚Äì Always know your maximum drawdown thresholds. (NO NAKED CALL OR PUT SELLING!)

## Correlation, Beta, and Hedging  

- **Correlated assets**: Assets whose prices move together. High correlation means less diversification benefit.  
  *Example*: oil prices and oil company stocks.  

- **Market beta (Œ≤)**: A measure of how sensitive an asset is to the overall market.  
  *Example*: A stock with Œ≤ = 1.2 tends to move 20% more than the market index.  

- **Hedging**: Taking a position that offsets risk in another.  
  *Example*: If long airline stocks, you might hedge with a long oil position (since rising oil hurts airlines).

## Portfolio Modelling Basics  

Before advanced models, simple tools include:  

- **Expected return** ‚Äì Weighted average of asset returns.  
- **Variance / standard deviation** ‚Äì Measure of portfolio risk.  
- **Covariance & correlation matrices** ‚Äì Show how assets move relative to each other.  

These tools answer:  
> *‚ÄúAm I actually diversified, or do I just own many correlated assets?‚Äù*

## Markowitz Portfolio Optimization  

Harry Markowitz formalized this in the 1950s with **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**:  

- Optimize weights of assets to **maximize expected return for a given risk**.  
- Uses **mean-variance optimization** to build the **efficient frontier**.  
- Core idea: A rational investor doesn‚Äôt just chase returns‚Äîthey balance returns against volatility.

## Closing Thought  

Every strategy‚Äîfrom a simple moving average crossover to advanced machine learning models‚Äîmust sit on top of **Step 0: Risk Management**.  

Without it, trading systems are fragile.  
With it, they can endure bad luck and survive long enough to benefit from skill.  
Market regimes change, and even the most sophisticated trading strategies eventually or periodically stop working.
Save some money and let your account live long enough to trade another day
