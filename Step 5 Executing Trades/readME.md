# 🧪 Step 5: Paper Trading — Simulate Before You Speculate

You’ve collected the data. You’ve defined the structure. You’ve labeled the events. Now it's time to take the next logical step:

> **Put your logic to the test in the wild — without risking a dollar.**

This stage is about running **paper trades** — live simulated executions using real-time (or delayed) market data. You’re not optimizing PnL yet. You’re testing whether your logic even holds up *in motion*.

## 🧠 Why Paper Trade?

- 🧪 Validate that your classifier or strategy **triggers as expected**
- 🧭 See if structure-based entries **actually occur in real-time**, not just hindsight
- ⌛ Detect **latency**, **slippage**, or **signal delays** you missed during backtests
- 📋 Build logs of simulated trades for future review and ML retraining
- 🧱 Begin designing your live trading infrastructure with **risk-free testing**

## 🛠 Tools You Can Use

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `alpaca-trade-api` | Free paper trading accounts, easy REST API |
| `ccxt` | Unified API for paper/live trading across crypto exchanges |
| `backtrader` | Supports paper trading logic with broker simulation |
| `pandas` + custom logic | Your own CSV-based logger for signal → fake order execution |
| `websocket-client` | For live event streaming from exchange feeds |

## 📋 What to Log During Paper Trades

- 🔁 Entry and exit timestamps
- 🧱 Structure or signal that triggered the trade
- 🧠 Classifier confidence / trigger conditions
- 💥 Real-time price action that followed
- 🪵 Comments: "entered on fake breakout", "exited early due to volume drop"

---

## ❌ What Not to Do

- ❌ Don’t optimize based on paper trade results — you’re still in the **truth-checking phase**
- ❌ Don’t obsess over minor drawdowns — look for **pattern consistency**, not perfection
- ❌ Don’t skip logging — what doesn’t get tracked, doesn’t get improved

## 📌 Final Word

> This is the test flight. Don’t polish the rocket — just make sure it launches, lands, and doesn’t blow up midair.

Use this stage to simulate the **mental mechanics of trading**, with real inputs and real reactions — just not real losses. Yet.
