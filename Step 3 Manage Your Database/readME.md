# 🗃️ Step 3: Manage Your Own Market Database

Once you start collecting and marking structure in your trading data, you’ll quickly realize:

> **APIs are great — until they aren’t.**

To scale your research, models, and backtests, you need a **personal, well-managed database** of market data that’s **versioned**, **queryable**, and **under your control**.

## 💡 Why You Should Manage Your Own Database

- 🔌 APIs go down, throttle requests, or retroactively adjust prices  
- ⌛ Waiting to query 100+ CSVs every time you backtest is a time sink  
- 🧠 Labeled event data, model predictions, and backtest results all need **persistent storage**
- 🏗️ If you're serious about building an R&D pipeline, you need **clean data at your fingertips**

## ✅ What Your Database Should Track

For each asset and timeframe, your database should include:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔢 Raw | OHLCV candles (1m, 5m, 15m, daily, etc.) |
| 🧱 Structure | Swing points, trends, consolidations, traps |
| 🧠 Signals | RSI, volume spikes, spoof score, LSTM output, etc. |
| 🏁 Outcomes | Label: Did it break down? Fake out? Lead to trend? |
| 📊 Strategy Metrics | PnL, drawdown, Sharpe, etc. |
| 🗂️ Meta | Source, ingestion time, market hours filter, etc. |
