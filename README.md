# 🧠 ALPHA | Event-Driven Market Classification & Trading Framework

This repository explores a structured approach to algorithmic trading that blends machine intelligence with human insight — because markets are not just math; they’re behavior.

While areas like **high-frequency trading** (HFT) are driven purely by machines reacting to microsecond data, **most retail-accessible strategies require a nuanced understanding of structure, trend, human psychology, and an assessment of value**. The intent here is not to automate reaction, but to **enhance interpretation** — to build systems that understand *what kind of market we’re in*, not just whether the RSI crossed 30.

## 📌 Philosophy

Markets are composed of **events**, not just prices.  
A sudden selloff at a high, a tight pullback into support, a fake breakout — these are patterns best recognized through a **human lens**, then formalized into rules that machines can process.

This framework embraces the idea that:
- The **human role in labeling and defining events** is critical to training smarter systems.
- The **1-minute chart should not be traded blindly** with predictive models — instead, it should be used to help **contextualize market structure** across multiple timeframes.
- The true edge lies in understanding **how price behaves**, not just where it is.

## 📈 Intended Use

This project is built to **classify and score market events across multiple timeframes**:
- ✅ Identify trend strength, consolidation, reversal zones
- ✅ Label institutional behaviors (e.g. spoofing, stop hunts, liquidity traps)
- ✅ Evaluate signals using 1-min, 5-min, 15-min, and daily chart structure
- ❌ **NOT intended for tick-based scalping or sub-minute trading execution**
