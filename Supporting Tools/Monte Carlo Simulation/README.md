# Monte Carlo Simulation Practice

## Inspiration
This part of the project grew out of a personal wake-up call. During a quantitative researcher exam, I stumbled on Monte Carlo simulation problems — not because they were conceptually impossible, but because I hadn’t built enough hands-on experience with them. That BIG miss motivated me to go back to fundamentals, practice systematically, and document my progress.  

## What is a Monte Carlo Simulation
For those of you who may not yet be familiar with Monte Carlo simulation, a Monte Carlo simulation is simply an exhaustive way to find the expected value of a certain outcome through multiple simulations rather than by calculating them by hand. At first glance, Monte Carlo simulation may be inefficient (and it is for simple problems), but it has great benefits when modelling more complex systems, such as financial markets, where there are complex reactions within order blocks, resting liquidity, and real-world events. 

Monte Carlo methods have enormous relevance beyond interviews. They are core tools in **financial markets** (risk modeling, option pricing, portfolio analysis), **statistics** (numerical integration, uncertainty quantification), and **engineering** (simulation of physical systems). The goal of this repo is to turn a weakness into a strength by building a library of clear, reproducible examples that can be extended into real-world applications. Hopefully, these examples may help you in whatever you, the reader, are pursuing as well.

## Goals
- Build intuition for how randomness converges to probability and expectation.  
- Practice implementing a range of Monte Carlo simulations in Python.  
- Connect each example back to potential applications in finance and decision-making.  
- Provide a reference point for myself (and others) who want fast, readable implementations.

This repo is both a study log and a toolkit — starting from very simple problems and building toward financial market applications.
