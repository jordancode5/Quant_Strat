# Monte Carlo Simulation Practice

## Inspiration
This project grew out of a personal wake-up call. During a quantitative researcher exam, I stumbled on Monte Carlo simulation problems — not because they were conceptually impossible, but because I hadn’t built enough hands-on experience with them. That BIG miss motivated me to go back to fundamentals, practice systematically, and document my progress.  

Monte Carlo methods have enormous relevance beyond interviews. They are core tools in **financial markets** (risk modeling, option pricing, portfolio analysis), **statistics** (numerical integration, uncertainty quantification), and **engineering** (simulation of physical systems). The goal of this repo is to turn a weakness into a strength by building a library of clear, reproducible examples that can be extended into real-world applications.  

## Goals
- Build intuition for how randomness converges to probability and expectation.  
- Practice implementing a range of Monte Carlo simulations in Python.  
- Connect each example back to potential applications in finance and decision-making.  
- Provide a reference point for myself (and others) who want fast, readable implementations.  

## Contents
- Dice and coin flip probability simulations   

## Tech Stack
- Python 3  
- NumPy (for vectorized simulations)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

This repo is both a study log and a toolkit — starting from very simple problems and building toward financial market applications.
