# 🧱 Step 2: Define Market Structure — Before the Machine Does

Before any machine can classify market behavior, **you** must define what structure *actually means*.

Algorithms don’t "see" flags, traps, or trend shifts unless someone teaches them how to interpret the terrain. Market structure is **not math alone** — it’s **context**, and it must be manually marked first.

## 🧠 Why Marking Structure Matters

- 📉 A head-and-shoulders pattern is just three local tops unless it's *contextually defined*
- 🧭 Without structure, indicators and signals are directionless
- 🧠 Human traders use implicit structure — machines need it *explicitly defined*
- ⚠️ No model knows the difference between a consolidation and a trap unless you tell it

## 🛠 What to Mark

At a minimum, for each chart (any timeframe: 1m, 5m, 15m, daily):

- **Highs and Lows** — swing points, breakouts, liquidity zones
- **Trend Regimes** — uptrend, downtrend, consolidation
- **Key Levels** — prior day highs/lows, VWAP rejection, order block zones
- **Events** — breakouts, fakeouts, panic candles, traps, squeezes

## 🖍️ Methods

- Use notebooks to annotate charts with matplotlib or `plotly`
- Build or use manual labeling tools (e.g. `labelbox`, `cvat`, or even Excel)
- Maintain a growing dataset of **labeled events** and **structure tags**

Example label format:
```csv
timestamp,structure_tag,price_level,note
2023-06-04 10:12:00,consolidation,1934.25,"tight range after fake breakout"
2023-06-04 10:45:00,liquidity_grab,1936.50,"tail candle spiked before reversal"
